# random_suit_generator
This python program helps a person randomly decide what type of suit combinations to wear.
The program is based on a video clip in which comedian and Family Fued host, Steve Harvey was answering
audience questions.
In the clip, Steve Havey gives recommendations on a variety of suit jackets, shirts, and pants to own to allow 
a person to have 75 different variety of suit combinations.
Such as . . . . .
Suit jacket colors: "Black", "Navy", "Gray", "Brown", and "Tan".
Shirt colors: "White", "Powder Blue", "Cream".
Pant Colors: "Black", "Navy", "Gray", "Brown", "Tan".

According to Steve Harvey, all the suit jacket and pant colors will coordinate with all the shirt colors.

The code uses the random import function to randomly generate a variety of colors for each article of clothing.
